B08412HXK9,102,Teresa D. Patterson,1.0,"In the description it stated that tri-color should yield 100 pages. Well, they must have mistakenly added an extra zero. I doubt that I printed 10 pages clearly before the ""Low Ink"" message and the images started to streak. I'm so disappointed. There used to be a time when HP was a reputable company. I guess they've joined all the other scammers. Every cartridge is half full of ink, if that. I am over them. I will be switching to Lexmark or back to Canon. Buying ink cartridges every other day is just not in my budget. HP, if you're going to charge an arm and a leg for ink cartridges, at least full them to capacity.","January 19, 2021",the United States,,They Tried It
B08412HXK9,70,Amazon Customer,1.0,Purchased Oct 1st and do not install till second week in November. Today is December 18th and I have had low ink light for over 2 weeks and I have not printed more then 20 pages top. Waste of money and disappointed I purchased this printer. It is hard to find the ink in stock and when you do it does not last!,"December 19, 2020",the United States,,Can't print more then 20 pages on 1 cartridge!
B08412HXK9,45,Amazon Customer,1.0,"Not sure why we didn't get a full run from the ink cartridges.  Printer itself  is less than 6 months old.  This is my 82 year old mother's printer....so she doesn't print a lot.  She inserted the newly printed ink cartridges on 1/06/2021, and made about 6 color copies and 25 black/white copies before she started having issues, and it stopped printing.  She had just made one copy that had appeared to print a color picture, but without any black ink.  Then it stopped allowing her to print anything.  Printer:  HP Envy 6000.  Anyone else having this issue, or suggestions to resolve.","January 26, 2021",the United States,,Possible bad batch of HP ink ?  Other cause for problem ?
B08412HXK9,43,Crash,1.0,"This color print cartridge only lasted through about 20 of my Christmas letters.  Granted, I filled a page with pictures, but I feel like it should have lasted longer than 20 color pages!  Very disappointed in this product and angry that I had to find another resource for getting my Christmas letters finished.  Now I'm out of ink again!  :(","December 22, 2020",the United States,,Didn't last. At all.
B08412HXK9,36,michelle b,1.0,I had this ink for no longer than 3 prints!!!!! I used it to print out 3 things and once the fourth item came out it showed marks of low ink!! I‚Äôm furious and am never buying from this again!,"January 8, 2021",the United States,,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!
B08412HXK9,31,Dan D.,2.0,"I needed to print twenty pages on one side only and the printer said replace cartridge. I did and it didn‚Äôt even make it through the twenty pages. I followed all the instructions and while it printed, it worked great. But then it started to run out and again I got a replace printer cartridge dialog. Scam?! Sent me an already empty cartridge?! Beware!","March 28, 2021",the United States,,Empty after not even twenty pages.
B08412HXK9,29,Noegel Roberts,1.0,"I have had these one month. I do not print very much at all, maybe a sheet or two every few days. When I installed these new cartridges, they became empty in one month. That's ridiculous. Junk.","February 28, 2021",the United States,,Runs Out in no Time
B08412HXK9,8,G. Silvestri,5.0,"These are the factory cartridges for my printer, and are therefore perfectly good for printing. Frankly, I prefer the HP 67 XL cartridges, which last much longer, but are more expensive.","December 21, 2020",the United States,,HP factory cartridges are reliably good
B08412HXK9,2,Marina,1.0,"I 've had to change the ink 3 times since i've purchased the printer in June.  But, I only print in black and white.  So, I only think to change the black ink but I still get the low ink alert.  No, this is not the case.  Ive updated the settings to print on the lowest ink to save and the low ink alert still continues to pop up with never using color.  Horrible ink.  Going back to laser printers.  DO NOT BUY","August 5, 2021",the United States,,Runs out of ink quick. DO NOT BUY
B08412HXK9,One,Donna P,5.0,"Printer died.  My brother the techie said he liked the HP Envy.  When I got it, there were no instructions on how to load toner.  By pressing all the buttons I finally figured it out.  I have to say, when I printed my first pages I really appreciated both the printer and these toners.  They seem to last longer and are 1/3 the price of what I used to have.  Happy customer.","September 16, 2021",the United States,,Reasonable price
B07H2V5YLH,689,Chenoa Jacobs,5.0,"This is the first time I‚Äôve used these screen protectors (or any, really!) and I found them pretty easy to apply. I bought the 3 pack for my husband and I‚Äôs new phones and while I used the 1st one for learning purposes, by the 3rd (my husbands phone üòè) it was pretty perfected. What I learned (so you don‚Äôt have to waste any)","May 19, 2019",the United States,,User friendly / read on for tips I learned!
B07H2V5YLH,477,Blessed4life,5.0,Dropped my phone the other night getting out of my Jeep and when looked I thought I just made a hundred dollar mistake. It was dark out so I thought I just destroyed my screen. When I got in the house and peeled off the screen protector it was the only thing cracked my screen was 100% fine. Would recommend this protector to anyone looking for a solid screen protector,"December 8, 2019",the United States,,Saved me $100 easy
B07H2V5YLH,317,Annabelle S,5.0,Bought this for my new iPhone 12. Put the glass on as soon as I took the phone out of the box. The install was ridiculously easy. Literally just peeled off the backing and it went on so smoothly with absolutely no bubbles. Perfect fit on the phone too.,"October 24, 2020",the United States,,Very satisfied
B07H2V5YLH,446,Grandpa Wilbur,5.0,"We have been using these Ailun screen protectors for a few months and I favor them over anything else that we have tried, for three reasons.","October 29, 2018",the United States,,"Clean, scratch resistant, and protective. Easy installation."
B07H2V5YLH,204,christian chapman,5.0,"This screen protector saved my brand new phone! I dropped it at the park while playing with the kiddos and thought for sure that my actual phone cracked. The pack comes with 3 and when I went to put a new protector on (just so my fingers wouldn‚Äôt slide on the cracked glass) I was WONDERFULLY SURPRISED that my phone was totally 100% fine. It really looked like the cracked webs were on the main screen, but nope! So happy with this purchase. I‚Äôm going to buy more because I‚Äôm a dropper. :)","January 28, 2019",the United States,,Durable and necessary preventative measure!
B07H2V5YLH,162,Dchaffins,5.0,This is a great product at a great value. You get three screen protectors along with three wet and dry wipes. The best part was how easy it was to install. I have bought screen protectors for all my phones and other devices and they have always required some readjustment or work to make sure the screen protector fit properly without any bubbles. I just placed this screen protector on the phone and pressed down in the Center and it adhered to the phone with no air bubbles at all. It was the easiest installation ever. This is my new go to screen protector.,"October 19, 2019",the United States,,Great product at a great price
B07H2V5YLH,156,Anthony Nuseng Yang,5.0,The screen protector glass came with 3 and installing everything together was very easy. I‚Äôm loving how my iPhone XR looks and this is a Yassss for me.,"March 25, 2019",the United States,,IPhone XR screen protector
B07H2V5YLH,89,Chuabacca,2.0,"This is a decent screen protector, but the edges aren‚Äôt rounded enough. It looks like they did grind the edges slightly because the reflections look rounded, but it still feels like a hard corner to the touch. This is especially noticeable when you swipe up to go to the home screen, which you do all the time on the XR. It doesn‚Äôt prevent you from using the phone, but it really detracts from the tactile experience. On a slightly more nit-picky note, the shape of the screen protector doesn‚Äôt exactly match the LCD portion of the screen. For those OCD types, it‚Äôs one of those things you can‚Äôt unsee. Durability is also questionable since the first protector I put on less than a week ago now has a crack in the top right corner. I dropped the phone once from about 2ft onto asphalt. The phone was in a case and there was no other noticeable damage.","November 2, 2018",the United States,,Sharp corners
B07H2V5YLH,48,Amazon_Customer,1.0,"I purchased this knowing the buyer mentioned it does not cover the entire screen.  That is to be expected for a glass screen protector that is case friendly.  But this does not appear to be the correct size for the iPhone XR.  There is a gap of a half a centimeter on each side of the glass and about a quarter of a centimeter between the top and bottom parts of the glass.  Overall it appears as if it is not the right screen protector for this model.  I have owned many phones and bought many screen protectors.  This was a gift for a family member and their new phone.  I was embarrassed by how much of the actual screen is left exposed with this screen protector on it.  I have never had something that was so out of touch with reality.  I don't know how this is considered ""precision"" cut or anything even close to that term.  They may be proud of the so called precision  of cutting the screen protector in the same general shape of the actual screen, but it is cut too small and appears very generic and almost like a universal screen protector that could be used on ANY phone with a similar notch.  I normally would have left a positive comment about things like installation, durability, and other aspects of this item.  But the ""fit"" is so off that it is hard for me to care much about how it performs.  I'm more concerned about how much of the screen is still exposed and susceptible to damage.  So back to the search for a quality screen protector that is cut properly... or precisely for the iPhone XR and not just a general shape of a screen with a notch.","October 17, 2019",the United States,,Seller does say this doesn't cover entire screen but it is not the right size for phone
B07H2V5YLH,55,CtryBy,1.0,For some reason then crack easily. Without even dropping them or banging them up. Two protectors now and I‚Äôve randomly noticed out of nowhere chips or cracks in them appearing. Customer service was unfortunate as I messaged them first and asked what was going on. Maybe a bad batch? Everyone seemed so happy with them in the reviews. I got a generic ‚Äúwe couldn‚Äôt possibly care less‚Äù response. It‚Äôs unfortunate. Because I have one left and now a task of finding another manufacturer to order from. It‚Äôs a relatively inexpensive product but honestly it would have been nice if someone had attempted to resolve this.,"June 10, 2019",the United States,,Cracks and Chips Randomly Appear
